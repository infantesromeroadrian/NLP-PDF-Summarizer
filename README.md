PDF Document Processing and Query Answering Project
Description
This project facilitates the downloading, loading, processing, and querying of PDF documents. It employs a series of Python scripts and a Streamlit application to provide an interactive user interface. The key functionalities include downloading PDF documents from URLs, loading these documents into memory, processing them into manageable segments, creating text embeddings of these segments, and finally performing queries and obtaining answers based on the documents' content. We're utilizing LangChain, a Python library, for enhancing our interaction with OpenAI language models and other NLP-related tasks.

Project Structure
The project is composed of several Python scripts, each focusing on a specific task:

PDFDownloader.py: Downloads PDF files from URLs.
PDFLoader.py: Loads PDF documents into memory.
DocumentSplitter.py: Splits documents into manageable segments.
DocumentEmbedder.py: Creates text embeddings of the segments.
QAChain.py: Performs queries and retrieves answers based on the documents' content.
main.py: The main script that utilizes all the above classes.
streamlit_app.py: Streamlit application for an interactive user interface.
Usage of LangChain
LangChain is a Python library used in this project to facilitate working with OpenAI's language models and other NLP tasks. It is used at several key points in the project:

PDFLoader: Uses LangChain's PyPDFLoader to load PDF documents.
DocumentSplitter: Employs RecursiveCharacterTextSplitter to split the documents into segments.
DocumentEmbedder: Utilizes OpenAIEmbeddings to generate text embeddings and Chroma to store these embeddings in a vector database.
QAChain: Sets up a query and answer process using ChatOpenAI and RetrievalQA from LangChain, combining OpenAI's chat model with the retriever object based on the processed documents.
